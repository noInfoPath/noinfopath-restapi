ODATA Usage
-----------
The NoInfoPath RESTAPI implements an ODATA query interface.  It is based on the ODATA V4 specification.

> This was implemented using an NPM library called `odata-v4-mongodb`. The implentation is flaw, and
> incomplete when have made some monkey patches to mitigate these shortcomings.
